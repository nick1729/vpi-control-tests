Task option #2

1. In a one-dimensional array consisting of N integer elements, calculate:
- the sum of the negative elements of the array. If there are no such elements, display a message about it;
- the number of even elements of an array located in front of the minimum element.
2. An integer array of dimension NxM is given. Define:
- the number of rows that do not contain any null elements;
- the maximum of the maximum numbers of each row of the array.
3. Use the random number generator to enter numbers from the range from -10 to 10 in the array C(20). Write a function that replaces with "0" all the elements up to the first negative, which in turn replaces with "1", and all the following elements replace them with modules. The modified display elements of the array in the function. Enter array elements and call the created function in the main program.
4. Create a array A(5, 5) using a random number generator. Write a function that outputs even elements located on the main diagonal of the matrix and determines the arithmetic mean of these elements. Enter matrix elements and call the created function in the main program.
5. Write a function that inserts a space after each dot in the string.
