Task option #4

1. In a one-dimensional array consisting of N integer elements, calculate:
- the sum of the array elements with odd numbers. If there are no such elements, display a message about it;
- multiplication of elements located between the first and last negative elements.
2. An integer array of dimension NxM is given. Define:
- the sum of elements in those columns that contain at least one negative element;
- numbers of those lines (the line) in which the number of positive elements is maximum.
3. Use a random number generator to enter numbers in the arrays X(20) and Y(20) from the range from -15 to 5. Write a function that counts the number of even elements in each array. Enter the elements of arrays and calling the newly created functions to implement in the main program. Determine in which of the arrays the found multiplication is larger.
4. Write a function that replaces negative elements with their modules in the matrix C(3, 5), increases positive elements whose value does not exceed 10 by 10, and counts the number of zero elements. Output the changed values with their indexes in the function. Enter the elements of the array (using a random number generator) and call the created function to implement in the main program.
5. Offer two options for the function that removes leading and trailing spaces from the string.
