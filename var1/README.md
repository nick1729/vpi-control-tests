Task option #1

1. In a one-dimensional array consisting of N integer elements, calculate:
- the number of array elements greater than the specified value C;
- convert the array so that odd elements are placed at the beginning of the array.
2. An integer array of dimension NxM is given. Determine:
- the number of even elements in the rows that do not contain zero elements;
- indexes of those lines (the line) in which the number of positive elements is maximum.
3. Use a random number generator to enter numbers from the range -15 to 25 in the arrays X(12) and Y(10). Write a function that calculates the arithmetic mean of positive elements in each array. Determine in which of the arrays the found value is greater.
4. Write a function that replaces negative elements with their modules in the array C(3, 5), increases positive elements whose value does not exceed 10 by 10, and counts the number of zero elements. Output the changed values with their indices in the function.
5. Given a string of characters. Convert a string by removing all non-letter characters from it.
