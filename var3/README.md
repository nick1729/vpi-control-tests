Task option #3

1. In a one-dimensional array consisting of N real elements, calculate:
- the number of elements whose value belongs to the range from 5 to 10 inclusive. If there are no such elements, display a message about it;
- the sum of elements located after the minimum element.
2. Given an integer square matrix with dimension NxN. Define:
- the first row that has a negative element, and order this row in descending order;
- the sum of the modules of the elements located on the main diagonal.
3. Use the random number generator to enter array Y(23) numbers from the range from -12 to 20 in the array. Write a function that calculates the arithmetic mean of positive even - valued elements of the array Y. Enter elements into an array and calling the newly created functions to implement in the main program.
4. Write a function that determines in each row of the matrix A(3, 5) the number of elements that satisfy the condition: the matrix element is smaller than the next, but larger than the previous one. Enter matrix elements (using a random number generator).
5. Write a function that checks whether the string it receives as a parameter has a period and a space before each capital letter other than the first (Latin alphabet).
